   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** and add tests
3. **Run the test suite**:

## What We're Looking For

### New Analyzers
- **Pattern-based analyzers** for specific vulnerability types
- **Framework-specific modules** (React, Vue, Express, etc.)
- **Language support** beyond JavaScript/TypeScript

### Improvements
- **Performance optimizations** for large codebases
- **Better accuracy** in vulnerability detection
- **Enhanced reporting** formats and visualizations
- **CI/CD integrations** (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)

### Bug Fixes
- **False positive reduction**
- **Edge case handling**
- **Cross-platform compatibility**

## Code Style

- Follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation for new analyzers
- Use meaningful commit messages

## Creating New Analyzers

All analyzers implement the `Analyzer` interface:

```typescript
export interface Analyzer {
  name: string;
  analyze(options: ScanOptions): Promise<Vulnerability[]>;
}
```

See `src/analyzers/secrets-analyzer.ts` for a complete example.

## Testing

- Add unit tests in `src/__tests__/`
- Test with real-world codebases
- Include both positive and negative test cases
